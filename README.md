## About the Project

Before writing a single-line of code, I spent a lot of time, **doing UI/ UX research, and performing extensive feasibility analysis**. After that pegged down the exact requirements and features that are must-haves and **created a Kanban Board** with all the features that must be implemented and started working on the project.

I have built this project using **React, Material UI, React-Router-Dom, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose**. Speaking broadly, I have taken design inspiration from [Halo Lab's Design on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/14398439-Oyoga-Website) and I have modified the design accordingly.

During user onboarding, **attention has been paid to UX** by incorporating a progressive bar which helps the user to know how much of the process is completed.

I have used Material UI, as it helps in reducing the redundant design components and enables in quicker development. One short-coming is definitely the lack of customisability, but I have **tried to overcome that by using CSS-in-JS.** 

**Modularization, and resuability** of components have been given **higher weightage.** All validations are done on the frontend and only then the data is punched to the backend.

A basic **caching strategy** has been implemented, which helps in reducing the number of read and write operations to the database. 

**Client-Side Caching** using LocalStorage has been implemented which prevents an extra write before the payment confirmation is received using Web Hook(for now a mock function).

On the backend, using Mongoose, **the models have been defined** and the data is stored in MongoDB Atlas. The ER diagram can be seen in the documentation. 

The **routes have been seperated** from the entry file of index.js to have better readability and maintainability.
